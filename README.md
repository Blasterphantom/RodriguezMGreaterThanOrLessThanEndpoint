# RodriguezMGreaterThanOrLessThanEndpoint
#Open Postman, run debug in vs code, copy paste url from debug console in vs code: ie. https://localhost:7021. After you do that, add /endpoint/greater to the end, and then a number with a slash before it, and then another number with a slash before it. Press send and the console should output which is greater than, less than, or equal to!

#Lerissa Lazar / works well, gives correct answers for all 3 outputs (greater than, less than, equal to) good job!
