# RodriguezMGreaterThanOrLessThanEndpoint
# This program will accept 2 strings at the end of the url in Postman. The endpoint name and Route will also be needed. It will convert the strings into int, compare the two, and output which is greater than, less than, or equal to.
#
# Lerissa Lazar / works well, gives correct answers for all 3 outputs (greater than, less than, equal to) good job!
